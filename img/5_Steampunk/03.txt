The interior of a steampunk room brimming with inventions and mechanics. Inside, there are brass gears decorated on the glass, complex copper instruments and equipment placed against the wall, and old leather armchairs on the brick floor. The warm light shone, and the beam of light passing through the glass window hit the ground. Rich in details, with a strong industrial feel, the texture of brass and leather, and an aged look.
